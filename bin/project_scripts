echo "
Running this script will expand the ds008_raw.tar.gz file from the archive into the ~/Projects, which
is where it should be run from. If ds008 already exists, it does not override the present directory.
"
echo

echo "-------------------------"
echo "01_brain_extraction_ds008"
echo "-------------------------"
echo "
Running this script will run the bet to do brain extraction on the highres001.nii.gz anatomical image
for each and every subject.
"
echo

echo "---------------------"
echo "02_check_images_ds008"
echo "---------------------"
echo "
Running this script allows the header information about the dimensions for:
	- volumes
	- slices
	- voxels
and the TR for functional time series (bold) files to be printed out. This information is looked for
and sourced from
	/anatomy/highres001.nii.gz
	/BOLD/task???_run???/bold.nii/gz
"
echo

echo "--------------------------"
echo "02_check_images_find_ds008"
echo "--------------------------"
echo "
Running this script will produce the same result as the script above, since they are logically equivalent.
However, this script uses find to locate the bold.nii.gz files.
"
echo

echo "--------------------"
echo "03_fix_bold_TR_ds008"
echo "--------------------"
echo "
Running this script allows the TRs in the bold files for the ds008 data set to be fixed. It searches the 
bold file for the values of pixdim1-pixdim3, changes the TR to the correct value of 2.000000 and prints the
new and old values for the 4 pixdims. It also creates a 00_TR_FIXED file in the same folder as the bold 
file to serve as an indication that the change in TRs has occurred.

echo

echo "--------------------------"
echo "04_prepare_bold_data_ds008"
echo "--------------------------"
echo "
Running this script allows the fsl_motion_outliers command to be run on all of the functional bold files
in the ds008 data set and creates:
	- a file with any confound images in it
	- a frame_displacement_vals.txt file with the framewised displacement measure in it
	- a frame_displacement_plot.png file
in a newly created motion_assess folder, within the task/run folder of the bold file being assessed.
An empty confound.txt file is created even if no confounds are found; design.fsf can always refer to this
text file.

This script is written in python and makes the bet slices for subjects in the ds008 dataset.
